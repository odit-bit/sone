#### Build from source
```
git clone https://github.com/odit-bit/sone.git
cd sone
go build -o ./bin/sone-server ./cmd/server
```

run server
```
./bin/sone-server -dir=/path/to/cache/stream -http=<port for playback> -rtmp=<port to ingress stream>
```


#### streaming (RTMP)
##### OBS
Set the destination server to `rtmp://localhost:1935/live`, and stream key to anything unique. stream-key use to distinct the stream coming from client.
start the streaming and visit to playback the stream [http://localhost:9696](http://localhost:9696)

##### ffmpeg
```
ffmpeg -re -i input.mp4 -c:v libx264 -preset veryfast -b:v 2800k -maxrate 2996k -bufsize 4200k -pix_fmt yuv420p -g 50 -c:a aac -b:a 128k -ac 2 -ar 44100 -f flv rtmp://localhost/live/{stream-key}.
```


### HOW
sone has 2 module ingest and playback.  
Server (rtmp) will receive rtmp protocol, serialized (to flv), transcode (ffmpeg) to playlist segment `.ts` file and store at disk (cache) before available for HLS distribution on http, it will store up to last 6 second of the stream for playback.
